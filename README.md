# Employee Database Analysis
Using http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com, I made an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the assignment CSVs.

I checked to see if each column was unique in each CSV. 
I created primary keys for unique columns.
I created an SQL table schema for each CSV and imported each CSV into the SQL table I had made for it.




I listed employee #, names, sex, and salary for each employee.
For employees, I found and displayed the names and hire dates for all the hires from 1986.
I made a list of all the dept. managers, showing dept. #, names, and dept. names for each manager.
I listed each employee's department, showing employee #, employee names, and department name.
I found all of the emplyees with first name "Hercules" and a last initial of "B" and displayed names and sex for all of those employees.
I listed employee #s, names, and department names for all the Sales dept. employees.
I listed all employee #s, names, and department names for all the employees in Sales and in Development.
Finally, I made a list of the counts of all the last names of employees, in order of decreasing count.
